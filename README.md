uaf-iceflow
===========

This is the content that appears at URL [pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/](http://pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/).  It is a "project page" for `uaf-iceflow`, in github lingo.  That is, it is not the "organization page" which would be at [here](http://pism.github.io).

This is a monster site only because it stores historical PDFs, some of which are at the 50Mb+ level so they trigger github's big-file warning.  These should not change, so I think we are safe.

This content was at the [Ice Sheet Modeling at UAF](http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/) page.  Bueler got to that page through `dogbert.gi.alaska.edu:~bueler/iceflow/`.
