uaf-iceflow
===========

This is the content that appears at URL [pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/](http://pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/).  It is a "project page" for `uaf-iceflow`, in github lingo.  That is, it is not the "organization page" for the [pism](https://github.com/pism) organization, which is currently unused but would go [here](http://pism.github.io).

This is a monster site only because it stores historical PDFs.  (Some of which are at the 50Mb+ level so they may trigger github's big-file warning.  These should not change, so I think we are safe.)

This content was formerly at the page http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/, but that link no longer works.
